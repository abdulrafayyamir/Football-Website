              Footballs have gone through a dramatic change over time. During medieval times balls were normally made from an outer shell of leather filled with cork shavings. Another method of creating a ball was using animal bladders for the inside of the ball making it inflatable. However, these two styles of creating footballs made it easy for the ball to puncture and were inadequate for kicking. It was not until the 19th century that footballs developed into what a football looks like today.</p>

            In the year 1863, the first specifications for footballs were laid down by the Football Association. Previous to this, footballs were made out of inflated animal bladder, with later leather coverings to help footballs maintain their shapes.In 1872 the specifications were revised, and these rules have been left essentially unchanged as defined by the International Football Association Board. Differences in footballs created since this rule came into effect have been to do with the material used in their creation.</p>

        <h2 id="Heading2">Vulcanisation</h2>
        <p>Vulcanisation is the treatment of rubber to give it certain qualities such as strength, elasticity, and resistance to solvents. In 1838, Charles Goodyear introduced vulcanized rubber, which dramatically improved the football. Vulcanisation of rubber also helps the football resist moderate heat and cold. Vulcanisation helped create inflatable bladders that pressurize the outer panel arrangement of the football. Charles Goodyear's innovation increased the bounce ability of the ball and made it easier to kick. Most balls of this time had tanned leather with eighteen sections stitched together. These were arranged in six panels of three strips each.</p>

        <h2 id="Heading3" >Reasons for improvement</h2>
        <p>During the 1900s, footballs were made out of leather with a lace of the same material (known as tiento in Spanish) used to stitch the panels. Although leather was perfect for bouncing and kicking the ball, when heading the football (hitting it with the player's head) it was usually painful. This problem was most probably due to water absorption of the leather from rain, which caused a considerable increase in weight, causing head or neck injury. By around 2017, this had also been associated with dementia in former players. Another problem of early footballs was that they deteriorated quickly, as the leather used in manufacturing the footballs varied in thickness and in quality.</p>

        <h2 id="Heading4">Present developments</h2>
        <p>Elements of the football that today are tested are the deformation of the football when it is kicked or when the ball hits a surface. The basic model considered the ball as being a spherical shell with isotropic material properties. The developed model also used isotropic material properties but included an additional stiffer stitching seam region.
